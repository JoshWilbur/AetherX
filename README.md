# AetherX
All code for this project is within Core/src. Detailed description coming soon

**Sensors:**
* LM61 - Temperature
* DHT20 - Relative humidity and temperature
* OPT101 - Light intensity at 650nm wavelength
* MAX9814 - Microphone with signal output

# TODO:
* Finish KiCad schematic (additional filtering for components)
* Signal processing for MAX9814 (frequency data via FFT, sound level in dB)
* Try out RTC
* Add button for standby mode
* Data logging (>24hrs)
* Add display and user input 
* Wireless daughter boards (STM32WB55, 3D print sphere case?)
* Finish altimeter code
* Design and construct PCB
