# AetherX
All code for this project is within Core/src. Detailed description coming soon

**Sensors:**
* LM61 - Temperature
* DHT20 - Relative humidity and temperature
* OPT101 - Light intensity at 650nm wavelength
* MAX9814 - Microphone with signal output

# TODO:
* Make KiCad schematic (additional filtering for components)
* Signal processing for MAX9814 (frequency data via FFT, sound level in dB)
* Try out RTC IC
* Add speaker for mic and other sounds
* Data logging (>24hrs)
* Add display and user input 
* Ethanol sensor?
* Finish altimeter code
* Design and construct PCB
